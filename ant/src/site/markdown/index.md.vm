About
====================
OWASP dependency-check-ant is an Ant Task that uses dependency-check-core to detect publicly
disclosed vulnerabilities associated with the project's dependencies. The task will
generate a report listing the dependency, any identified Common Platform Enumeration (CPE)
identifiers, and the associated Common Vulnerability and Exposure (CVE) entries.

Installation
====================
1. Download dependency-check-ant from [bintray here](http://dl.bintray.com/jeremy-long/owasp/dependency-check-ant-${project.version}-release.zip).
2. Unzip the archive
3. Add the taskdef to your build.xml:

    ```xml
    <!-- Set the value to the installation directory's path -->
    <property name="dependency-check.home" value="C:/tools/dependency-check-ant"/>
    <path id="dependency-check.path">
       <pathelement location="${dependency-check.home}/dependency-check-ant.jar"/>
        <fileset dir="${dependency-check.home}/lib">
            <include name="*.jar"/>
        </fileset>
    </path>
    <taskdef resource="dependency-check-taskdefs.properties">
       <classpath refid="dependency-check.path" />
    </taskdef>
    ```
4. Use the defined taskdefs:
    * [dependency-check](configuration.html) - the primary task used to check the project dependencies.
    * [dependency-check-purge](config-purge.html) - deletes the local copy of the NVD; this should rarely be used (if ever).
    * [dependency-check-update](config-update.html) - downloads and updates the local copy of the NVD.


It is important to understand that the first time this task is executed it may
take 10 minutes or more as it downloads and processes the data from the National
Vulnerability Database (NVD) hosted by NIST: https://nvd.nist.gov

After the first batch download, as long as the task is executed at least once every
seven days the update will only take a few seconds.
