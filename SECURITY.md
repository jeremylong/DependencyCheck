## Reporting a Vulnerability

If a security vulnerability is identified in dependency-check please
open an [issue](https://github.com/jeremylong/DependencyCheck/issues/new/choose)
and/or submit a PR to resolve the identified vulnerability.

The team is very responsive to reported vulnerabilities - historically having reported issues resolved in 30 days or less.

Note - there are several vulnerable test dependencies and test resources. These are never executed or included in a release; these vulnerable resources are present so that the functionality of dependency-check can be tested (i.e. it correctly identifies the given vulnerable test dependency).
