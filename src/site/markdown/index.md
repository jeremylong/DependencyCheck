About
====================
OWASP dependency-check is an open source solution the OWASP Top 10 2013 entry:
[A9 - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2013-A9-Using_Components_with_Known_Vulnerabilities).
Dependency-check can currently be used to scan Java and .NET applications to 
identify the use of known vulnerable components. Experimental analyzers for 
Python, Ruby, PHP (composer), and Node.js applications; these are experimental
due to the possible false positive and false negative rates. To use the experimental
analyzers they must be specifically enabled via the appropriate _experimental_
configuration. In addition, dependency-check has experimental analyzers that can 
be used to scan some C/C++ source code, including OpenSSL source code and projects
that use [Autoconf](https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/) or
[CMake](http://www.cmake.org/overview/).

The problem with using known vulnerable components was covered in a paper by
Jeff Williams and Arshan Dabirsiaghi titled, "[The Unfortunate Reality of
Insecure Libraries](http://www1.contrastsecurity.com/the-unfortunate-reality-of-insecure-libraries?&amp;__hssc=92971330.1.1412763139545&amp;__hstc=92971330.5d71a97ce2c038f53e4109bfd029b71e.1412763139545.1412763139545.1412763139545.1&amp;hsCtaTracking=7bbb964b-eac1-454d-9d5b-cc1089659590%7C816e01cf-4d75-449a-8691-bd0c6f9946a5)"
(registration required). The gist of the paper is that we as a development
community include third party libraries in our applications that contain well
known published vulnerabilities \(such as those at the
[National Vulnerability Database](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/search)\).
