        Making an egg containing DLL
        ============================
        
        Given Windows model for DLLs, when several python packages depends on the same
        dll to be shared between extensions, it may be useful to have a "DLL egg" which
        put the dlls within the python installation such as the dll are automatically
        found by any extension to the corresponding python interpreter.
        
        Usage:
        
        ::
                make-dll-egg -m PKG-INFO foo.dll bar.dll
        
        This will create a DLL with metadata taken from the PKG-INFO file, containing
        both foo and bar dlls.
